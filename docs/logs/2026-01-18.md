# Sun 18 Jan 2026 | Researching the Purdue Model

## What I did
- I started off by writing down the Epics that i'll be adding adding to RigAtlas's Azure DevOps sprint plan sometime this upcomming week.
- As usual, each Epic needs a level of research and understanding, as it's possible to add things that arent necessary for this project.
- After doing a lot of reading some of the Epics had to be scrapped as they steer me away from the main target of the project.
- I also decided to write up a 'problem.md' file which basically explains what problem im solving, it just felt right that I write this, as itll be my guide to make sure I stay on track.
- I did a lot more reading into 'Process twin' which is something Honeywell Forge Ltd are planning on implementing this year (2026). I ended Up deciding it's scope creep.
- I have however stumbled into something similar which fits into my project, and that's the Asset Health/Twin. More info on this on a different day cos I'm still clueless.
- Did more research and reading into the Purdue Model. I thought I understood it well, but there’s quite a lot I’m still yet to grasp.

## Decisions
- No notable decisions where made today, just a bunch of research and reading so i can make sure RigAtlas is actually solving an existing problem.

## Next
- These Epics still need to be added, im still drafting up the descriptions & Features. I need more domain knowledge though, hence the reading/research today:
  - CVEs / vulnerability management
  - System design & architecture
  - DevOps / CI-CD / containers
  - Performance, load, and stress testing
- Think through how these new Epics actually fit into RigAtlas instead of just dumping them in.
- Start sketching out features for each of them once the Epics feel right.
