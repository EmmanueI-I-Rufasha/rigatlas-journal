# The Problem RigAtlas Is Solving

RigAtlas exists to address a specific set of problems observed in offshore and industrial environments not by replacing existing enterprise systems, but by making complex systems easier to understand.

The offshore industry already uses a wide range of software platforms for asset management, maintenance, and operations. However, the presence of software does not mean the underlying problems are solved well.

RigAtlas focuses on **clarity, visibility, and understanding**, rather than ownership of data.

## 🧩 Asset Visibility Is Fragmented

On an offshore rig, information about equipment, systems, and infrastructure is rarely centralized in a way that engineers actually trust.

In practice:
- Asset data is split across multiple systems
- Diagrams often exist as outdated PDFs
- Maintenance history lives separately from system topology
- Engineers frequently cross check multiple sources to understand one asset

The result is uncertainty:
- What is installed?
- What is connected to what?
- Which representation is correct?

RigAtlas is designed to provide a **rig centric view** that helps engineers understand assets in context, rather than as disconnected records.

## 🧠 Tribal Knowledge Is Bleeding Out

A significant amount of operational knowledge in offshore environments lives outside formal systems.

This knowledge often exists as:
- Personal experience
- Informal notes
- Conversations
- Workarounds learned over time

As senior engineers retire and contractors rotate, this context is lost. New personnel are left with documentation that explains *what* a system is, but not *how it behaves in reality* or *what to be careful of*.

RigAtlas is intended to support the capture and association of this contextual knowledge alongside technical structures preserving understanding, not just specifications.

## 👁️ Visualization Is Poor or Non Existent

Most existing tools present information in tables, forms, or static documents.

However, engineers tend to think spatially and relationally:
- Where is this asset?
- What does it connect to?
- What depends on it?
- What breaks if it changes?

Without clear visual representations, understanding system level impact becomes slow and error prone.

RigAtlas focuses on **visualizing relationships** between assets, networks, and systems so that engineers can reason about complexity more intuitively.

## ⚖️ Existing Solutions Do Not Mean the Problem Is Solved

Are there already solutions in the oil rig industry?

Yes. Absolutely.

Big ones include:
- IBM Maximo  
- SAP PM / EAM  
- AVEVA / OSIsoft PI  
- Honeywell Forge  
- Emerson AMS  
- Dragos  

But here’s the key thing that most people miss.

- The existence of solutions does **not** mean the problem is solved well.
- The fact that there are solutions out there that already exist isn’t a deal breaker at all, because if the sentiment that *“solutions that already exist kill products”* were true, there would only be:
  - One CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
  - One accounting tool  
  - One ticketing system  
  - One cloud provider  

What kills projects like RigAtlas isn’t competition it’s building something vague.

In other words, the real danger is not that a product like RigAtlas exists somewhere else already. The real danger is when RigAtlas becomes vague in the sense that it tries to do **everything for everyone**, instead of focusing on one strong and narrow target: **visualisation as a first class capability**.

This focus puts RigAtlas in a position where it can be integrated into larger existing systems and platforms such as Dragos, IBM Maximo, Honeywell Forge, SAP, or AVEVA systems that do many things at once because they have the budget, scale, and investment to do so.

RigAtlas does not compete on breadth.

RigAtlas’s competitive advantage emerges from being exceptionally good at visualising and making sense of data on a customer site.

At the end of the day, not everyone is technical or comes from a technical background. Many non technical personnel understand systems and sub-systems better when they can **see them visually**, and that is precisely what RigAtlas is designed to do.

So instead of framing the question as:

> *“Is there existing software out there that solves the problem RigAtlas is trying to solve?”*

The correct framing is:

> *“Does the existing software in the market solve this problem well?”*

And the answer to that is **no**, largely because the major platforms in this space focus on very broad problem areas such as:

**Cybersecurity & Risk**
- Asset Visibility & Inventory  
- Threat Detection & Threat Intelligence  
- Vulnerability Management  
- Incident Response & Forensics  

**Operations & Maintenance**
- Predictive Maintenance & Health Monitoring  
- Work Order & Lifecycle Management  
- Operational Data History (Historian)  
- Digital Twins & Process Simulation  
- Regulatory Compliance & Reporting  

Providing all of these capabilities at once means these platforms cannot focus deeply on any single niche in the way RigAtlas can.

## 🧭 What RigAtlas Is, and Is Not

RigAtlas is **not** intended to replace:
- Enterprise Asset Management systems
- Maintenance planning tools
- Vendor specific platforms

Instead, it acts as a **clarity layer**:
- A visual and contextual representation of complex systems
- A way to understand how assets relate to one another
- A tool to support reasoning, not just record keeping

The goal is not to store everything, but to make sense of what already exists.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

In high risk, high complexity environments, misunderstandings are costly.

RigAtlas is built on the belief that:
> Better understanding leads to better decisions.

By improving how systems are visualized and understood, RigAtlas aims to reduce ambiguity and support safer, more informed engineering work.
